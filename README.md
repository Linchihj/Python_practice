This repository contains some small Python apps that I created for practice. 
The apps are as follows:
1. Magic 8 ball app : Allows a user to ask a question and gives a random answer.
2. Taiwan post domestic delivery fee calculator: A simple calculator made with python that calculates the total delivery costs for packages shipped in Taiwan using the domestic post service.
